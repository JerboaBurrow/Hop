### TLDR

- fork -> branch -> make changes -> squash minor/wip/broken commits -> pr

### Not all contributions have to be code

Bug reports, feature ideas, and refactoring suggestions are very welcome in the issues tab. Feel free to submit an issue for these.

### General (best case) workflow for code contributions

- Create an issue with proposed changes, identifying the problems and fixes
  - This way we know who is doing what, we minimise wasted time
- Discuss approaches in the issue
- Fork, and implement changes on a new branch in your fork
- Test the code compiles
- PR when the code compiles and runs locally
- Automated tests (i.e. the code compiles) must pass

- Your code will be tested (manually) on some physical devices to catch any issues
    - (Desktop) currently including MacBook pro (something), and an ubuntu machine
    - (Android) Currently including: Nexus 5, Google Pixel, Sony Xperia I (Original), and maybe a Samsung S9 if it feels up to it 
    - This may take some time to do, please be patient, it really does save time in the long run though

- If all is well your PR will be merged
- Please indicate what name (can be some social handle, including a link as well) to appear in credits
